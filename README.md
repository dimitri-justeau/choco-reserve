Choco-reserve is a solver for the *nature reserve problem* (also known as the *reserve design* and *reserve selection* problem).

It is based on the [Choco](https://github.com/chocoteam/choco-solver) Constraint Programming (CP) solver, and [Choco-graph](https://github.com/chocoteam/choco-graph), its extension for handling graph variables.

Choco-reserve implements the model described in [Justeau-Allaire et al. 2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-98334-9_33) (available for free download [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327167708_Unifying_Reserve_Design_Strategies_with_Graph_Theory_and_Constraint_Programming_24th_International_Conference_CP_2018_Lille_France_August_27-31_2018_Proceedings)).
